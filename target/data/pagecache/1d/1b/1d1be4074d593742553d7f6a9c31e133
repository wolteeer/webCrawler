You built your app for thousands - no - millions of users, and it won’t improve the world, or your bank balance, if you’re the only one using it. But your chances of going from tens of downloads to millions can be improved by having a marketing plan. Thinking about the life cycle of an app can be an effective way to create a plan because you can match certain tactics to phases of the app. As an example, we’ve outlined six different phases of an app’s lifecycle and tactics relevant to those stages. </p>

       <p> <strong class="section-text-color">Phase 1: Concepting</strong><br> At this stage your app is conceptual and you haven’t written a single line of code or even have a name for your app, so how can you market it? In the concept stage you’re marketing yourself and your ability, not necessarily your app.<br> <br> Crowdfunding: If your app needs funding then a crowdfunding platform (see Chapter 2) is a good way to validate your idea and source income. When you post your app on a crowdfunding site, you’re in effect posting your first ad. You’re announcing to the world what it is you want to build and why it’s a good idea, but really you’re promoting yourself. View websites like <a class="section-text-color" href="http://www.appbackr.com/" target="_blank">Appbackr</a> for crowdfunding examples.<br> <br> Building a website and social network presence: Even without a working app, you can still begin to establish your brand through a simple website and build your community on social networks, like <a class="section-text-color" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/+/learnmore/" target="_blank">Google+</a>. Whether your crowdfunding appeal is successful or not, you’ve still exposed your idea to interested people who may become testers or paying users later on. So set up a way for these people to follow your story and begin to build a community. Grand Cru is a development company based in Finland that focuses on mobile and social games. Prior to the launch of their debut game, Supernauts, they created an online presence with their <a class="section-text-color" href="http://grandcrugames.com/" target="_blank">website</a> and also created a social network <a class="section-text-color" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSupernauts" target="_blank">page</a> to build excitement. </p>

       <p> <strong class="section-text-color">Phase 2: Testing</strong><br> By now, the alpha version of your app is in the hands of a few trusted testers. You’re ironing out the kinks and adapting your app to early user feedback. At this point, focus on getting the basics right.<br> <br> <i><strong>Name your app.</strong></i> You might not consider your app’s name to be a part of your marketing strategy, but get it wrong at your peril. If you choose a name that doesn’t resonate with users, is too hard to pronounce or is misleading then your app may flounder. Check out Dan Rose’s article, <a class="section-text-color" href="http://www.creativebloq.com/apps/tips-naming-app-9112818" target="_blank">‘Top 10 Tips for Naming Your App’</a>, on the Creative Bloq website for some excellent advice.<br> <br> Marvin Paul, co-founder of <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.capigami.outofmilk&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Out of Milk</a>, knew that a good name was important to their overall strategy. <i>“For me, the name is very important. I feel lucky that we came up with the name ‘Out of Milk’. Before I start any project I need a name for it. So for this app I posted a message to my friends asking for name suggestions for a shopping list app, and people gave me some ideas. The final name didn’t come about through that, but it was a good process and helped us eliminate some ideas. Eventually, we chose a well-known expression.”</i><br> <br> <i><strong>Design your app icon.</strong></i> Your app icon may be small, but it does so much. It serves as a key visual element on your app store listing page to draw users in; it captures what your app is about in a single image, and it serves as the button that will get tapped countless number of times each day by users to open up your app. A good designer can help you realize what you want to communicate with your icon. Or, you can do it yourself, which is what Szymon Klimaszewski, creator of the <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.szyk.myheart&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Blood Pressure</a> app did. The logo for his app looks good and conveys the purpose of the app. <i>“Having a good app icon is very important. Fortunately I’m familiar with Maya, a 3D software design package, Photoshop and Gimp because of my interest in graphics. That gave me a knowledge base to create a logo myself. I had the idea of a heart icon, and I wanted to connect this idea with blood pressure, and the idea of an ECG graph. So the icon was designed and became my logo.”</i> </p>

       <p> <i><strong>Tell friends and family.</strong></i><br> During this phase you can establish beta testing groups among friends and family. Consider them to be your inner circle of testers, but keep them engaged and empowered by listening to their feedback. Create simple surveys using tools like <a class="section-text-color" href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/87809?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Spreadsheets</a> to collect their thoughts in a structured way. You may want to cast a wider net and solicit testers via social networks.<br> <br> <strong class="section-text-color">Phase 3: Launching</strong><br> The day has come, your app has launched and it’s available for download by users other than your friends. You await eagerly the world’s reckoning.<br> <br> <i><strong>Create an excellent app store listing</strong>:</i> By now, you’ll have an app store listing, and getting this page right will be critical to your success because it’s your global shop window. Here are some pointers:<br> <br> <i><strong>Invest in high-quality screenshots.</strong></i> Many users view screenshots before downloading an app to see what they’re getting. Make sure the screenshots in your listing give the user a good overview of the major app screens, or have them ‘tell the story’ of your app. And be authentic; make sure they’re accurate and up to date. PicsArt has <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picsart.studio&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">great visuals</a> on their listings page.<br> <br> <i><strong>Invest in a video.</strong></i> As users browse through an app store deciding which app to download, it’s useful to have as much information about the app as possible. Videos are an excellent way to show a user the app’s functionality, especially for paid apps. </p>

         <p> <i>“Video is one part of the marketing puzzle but it’s an important one because next to trying an app, it’s the best way for a user to know what an app is about and explain its value.”</i><br> <br> <i>“Different apps require different types of video. For instance, videos for games should show the gameplay. For other apps it’s good to explain the use case and show how the user will be using it in situ. Ideally videos should be between 30 to 60 seconds long.”</i> </p>

         <p> <i>“Also, a video is a good way to engage journalists and bloggers. These people receive many press releases for apps but won’t be able to download each app to try. Including a video link gives them a taste of the app and encourages them to download it so they can review it in full.”</i><br> <br> But remember, <i>“Having a good video won’t fix a bad app, so make sure your product is good.”</i><br> <br> We like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vyclone.angles&amp;hl=en">Vyclone’s clever video</a>, which serves to promote the app but also doubles up as a demonstration of what the app does! </p>

       <p> So writing a good title and description in your listing, and choosing relevant keywords, can be essential to help drive discovery of your app.<br> <br> There are many app listing pages which are poorly written, so keep in mind these tips when writing your listing:<br> <br> </p> 
       <ul class="bullets"> 
        <li>Write for your audience. For example, if your app is an educational tool for kids (such as <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learninga_z.onyourown&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Raz-Kids</a>), call out the benefits to the parents. </li> 
        <li>Don’t make it hard for users to understand what the app does. State its purpose up front and include 2-3 of the app’s killer features. </li> 
        <li>Highlight great reviews and testimonials, from either users or the press if you have them. <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vyclone.angles&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Vyclone</a> does a good job of this. </li> 
        <li>Be clear about its limitations. The description for the <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.szyk.myheart&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Blood Pressure app</a>, for instance, makes it clear that users still need a blood pressure monitor to use the app. </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> <br> <i><strong>Use house ads and cross promotion</strong></i>. If you have a portfolio of apps with existing users already, why not give your app a shot in the arm at launch by using house ads? These are ad units which help you cross-promote your new app to users of your other established apps. When it comes to set-up, manually placing these ads in your apps would be time consuming, so many developers choose an ad network to handle the ad serving. AdMob offers a free house ad service, and has a simple process for creating <a class="section-text-color" href="https://support.google.com/admob/v2/answer/3210452?hl=en" target="_blank">house ad</a> campaigns. You can refine the targeting settings of the campaign to reach the right audience (such as showing ads to users in certain countries, or even targeting ads based on demographic criteria). When you choose an ad network look for those options as they’ll help you achieve better results. </p>

       <p> With AdMob, you can combine house ads with mediation (see Chapter 4) to take advantage of every impression in your app. This is useful when the networks in your mediation stack can’t fill an ad request. Instead of an empty ad slot, you can show ads from your house ad campaign instead to promote your other apps. This can help you attain new users at no cost.<br> <br> App development company Fingersoft had a lot of success promoting their <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fingersoft.hillclimb&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Hill Climb Racing</a> game with house ads. It wasn’t their first app: other apps, created in 2011 and 2012, such as ‘Cartoon Camera,’ and ‘Night Vision Camera’ already had users, so it made sense to cross-promote and leverage that user base.<sup>[28]</sup> </p> 
      </div> 
      <div class="text-column-container"> 
       <p> <i><strong>Try peer-to-peer distribution.</strong></i> There are two major ways that peer-to-peer distribution can help you acquire many new users. First, it’s a method of marketing where you partner with other developers to advertise your app on their apps. Developers you seek out for this purpose may have a good-sized portfolio of apps, or maybe a handful of really popular ones, but the point is they have a much larger volume of users than you that they can leverage. So why not seek out friendly developers open to doing a deal with you? As you reach out, be prepared to bargain because these types of deals are unlikely to be free. In many cases the distributing developer will want a share of your app’s revenue.<br> <br> Second, a more formal version of peer-to-peer distribution is when the larger party publishes the app on behalf of the smaller party. It’s a chance for you to piggyback on others’ success and it’s been proven to work well. Some large developers, <a class="section-text-color" href="http://www.rovio.com/" target="_blank">Rovio</a> for example, launched their Stars program recently which is designed to help app developers with distribution (Rovio has a user base numbering more than 100 million across their games). Kalle Kaivola, Senior Vice President of Product &amp; Publishing at Rovio Entertainment, explains some of the benefits: “We have a lot to offer to the developers in terms of helping them put the finishing touches to the project. Under Rovio Stars we do a bit more than a traditional publisher does in helping with the game project, things such as lending our expertise in QA and marketing.”<sup>[29]</sup><br> <br> <i><strong>Leverage social media and blogs.</strong></i> If you maintain a blog, or are active across several social media channels, then time your launch announcements in a coordinated way to maximize the impact. And don’t desert your followers. If you start using social networks then post regular updates; it’s the only way you’ll maintain a following.<br> <br> Granted, not everyone has time to manage a social network. So another tactic is to let your users do your social marketing for you. If you have a great app then users will tell their friends about it. You can enable these conversations by adding social features to your app. We like how social sharing has been integrated into the <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fingersoft.hillclimb&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Hill Climb Racing</a> game. After you crash your car, the app generates a screenshot which you can post to your social networks along with your score. </p>

If you reach this point you may find many new marketing opportunities coming your way.<br> <br> <i><strong>Featuring on the app stores.</strong></i> To many developers this is the holy grail of free app marketing; a prominent position on an app store’s front page, or at least on a category page, can significantly boost your number of users in a short space of time. For example, the messenger app <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liquable.nemo&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Cubie</a> was featured on the Google Play Store’s frontpage for nine days, and according to their business development manager, James Hill, it had a huge effect, <i>“Before we got on Google Play, our total downloads across iOS and Android were averaging between 15,000 to 20,000 per day. After being featured on Google Play, we were getting over 50,000 downloads per day on Android alone.”</i><sup>[30]</sup><br> <br> So what’s the catch? You can’t choose to be featured on Google Play, the Play Store’s editorial team picks you. However, you can improve your chances by building a great app which adheres to Android design best practices and also has a great rating from users. To learn more about featuring, read <a class="section-text-color" href="http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/about/visibility.html" target="_blank">this overview</a> on the Android Developer website. </p>

       <p> <i><strong>Respond to user feedback and fix bugs quickly.</strong></i> While fixing bugs may not sound like a classic marketing tactic, it can directly impact your rating and hence downloads. During this phase of acceleration your users will surprise you by discovering new bugs, and frustrated users can be unforgiving in their reviews and give your app a low rating. But users are equally vocal and delighted when you fix the problem.<br> <i><strong>License your app to a publishing house.</strong></i> As your app takes off you may suddenly have more work than you bargained for. You might have support issues to contend with (emails from users), as well as thinking about new ways to improve your app. That can leave you with little time to build an app for another platform, so licensing your app to a publishing house is an option. In this scenario you negotiate a deal with a publisher, whereby they pay you a licensing fee for a period of time to build, publish and promote your app. They earn a share of the profits from your app until the agreement expires. </p>

       <p> <strong class="section-text-color">Phase 5: Leveling</strong><br> You’ve achieved a steady number of users but growth has plateaued.<br> <br> <i><strong>Run paid in-app ad campaigns:</strong></i> You can pay to advertise your app inside other apps, which is known as in-app advertising. It can be a very effective way to grow your user base because you’re addressing a highly engaged audience. In other words, app users who are exposed to ads in apps are often willing to try new apps, and gratification is instant (courtesy of the app download). AdMob research shows that more than a quarter of smartphone users in the US and UK feel comfortable with in-app ads which promote games or apps similar to ones they already use.<sup>[31]</sup> </p>

       <p> Costs for paid ad campaigns can be easier to manage once you have a reasonably-sized user base, and you understand more about how users are engaging with your app. One of the first mistakes an app developer makes when running a paid ad campaign is paying too much or too little for users. Once you have users, and you’re collecting data on how much money you’re making from your app, you can calculate your average revenue per user (ARPU) or even daily average revenue per user (DARPU) if you need it. This gives you a good guide for what a user is worth to you and can help you with your ads bidding strategy. </p>

           <i><strong>Experiment with multiple ads.</strong></i> Most ad networks give you the option of running multiple ads for free. So when you create your campaign don’t settle for one text ad, try two or three, each with a different message and let the one that generates the most downloads be the one you use most frequently. With AdMob it’s easy to edit your ads on the fly to keep your ad copy competitive and current.

You set a target cost per acquisition (e.g. say you’re willing to pay $1 for each install), and the Conversion Optimizer will automatically adjust your campaign to serve ads to users who are most likely to click on the ad and install your app. Games developer GREE saw a 150% improvement in their app download rate when they used the tool.

       <p> <i><strong>Use remarketing to boost engagement and revenue.</strong></i> Let’s say you’ve got fifty thousand users of your gaming app. Half are 7-day active users who spend a lot in your app, the rest are 30-day active users who don't spend much at all. If you could get the 30-day actives to play the game more often they’d become more engrossed in the narrative and would increase their spending. But how do you bring users back to your app? Remarketing lets you target users of your app with ad messages as they engage with other apps. This prompts them to return to your app, and you can incentivize their return with special offers or promotions. </p>

       <p> Localizing your app means more than adapting the user-interface language, it’s about being culturally sensitive too. App developer, RV App Studios, created the popular <a class="section-text-color" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rvappstudios.zombieragdoll&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Zombie Ragdoll</a> game in twenty languages. They immediately began seeing significant usage in countries where they hadn’t seen much traction before. Part of their success comes not only from localizing text within a game, but also localizing game features to specific countries and cultures. Vivek Dave, founder of RV App Studios emphasizes this point, <i>“Users want a personalized experience, and by offering a localized game with translation of text and graphic assets, we believe users will connect at a much deeper level with the game.”</i><sup>[33]</sup><br> <br> In an effort to better understand consumer app behavior, perceptions, and preferences, AdMob conducted a new survey across five major markets: China; South Korea; Japan; the United States, and the United Kingdom. The study provides you with data and analysis to help you optimize your design, marketing, and monetization of your app. Key insights from cross-country comparisons can help you understand adjustments you could make for consumers in different markets.<br> <br> Though users in all surveyed markets have experienced poor localization, app users in Asian markets are much more likely to feel the pain. A staggering 53% of Chinese respondents and over a third of Japanese and South Korean users have felt the app they were using was poorly adapted to their needs. Approximately 25-30% of users discontinued app usage as a result. Even for an app that was good quality, over 10% of users in China and Japan responded that they would stop using the app due to poor localization. If your goal is to distribute to a worldwide audience, we strongly encourage you to localize. </p>

       <span class="main-text">We build apps for global markets. We have some apps which are Russian brands. High quality titles will only yield return if they are popular globally. We have an idea about what kind of experience users will like, and we have to be culturally sensitive about politics and religion. And we have to be careful of producing art or other things which are only understandable in one market.</span>

           <p> <span class="subhead section-text-color">Choosing a Business Model</span><br> <i><strong>Of the markets surveyed, China is the only one in which the majority of users are willing to pay for apps.</strong></i><br> <strong>Fact</strong> 68% of users budget some amount for app purchasing. However, paid apps are also quickly being pirated. The New York Times reports that digital piracy is widespread in China and that alternative app stores often provide unauthorized knockoffs for download.<sup>[34]</sup><br> <strong>Recommendation</strong> Experiment with different app monetization models, and don’t exclude the paid model. An alternative strategy is to use a freemium model and release new versions of your app frequently to avoid being pirated.<br> <br> <i><strong>Chinese users are more likely to try freemium apps in comparison to other business models.</strong></i><br> <strong>Fact</strong> 46% of users have upgraded from a free to a paid version of an app. In the 30 days prior to the survey, 72% of gaming app spending was on in-app purchases.<br> <strong>Recommendation</strong> Since users are likely to pay for an upgrade of a good free app, be sure that your initial free version is high quality. </p> 
           <p> <span class="subhead section-text-color">Getting Discovered</span><br> <i><strong>The strength of a brand is very important to Chinese users.</strong></i><br> <strong>Fact</strong> 80% of respondents in China reported downloading their gaming apps from a major brand or company they knew well before downloading the app.<br> <strong>Recommendation</strong> If you’re a new developer, consider teaming up with a well-known publisher who can release the app on your behalf.<br> <br> <i><strong>Chinese users rely most upon search engines to find new apps.</strong></i><br> <strong>Fact</strong> 26% of Chinese users use search engines, versus 14% who browse app stores.<br> <strong>Recommendation</strong> Users feel more comfortable searching for brands that they’re already familiar with and trust, as a filter through the overabundance of apps and app stores. In addition to working with established publishers, research your local market to find the right stores to reach your app’s target audience.<br> <br> <i>“In practice, if we could cover 10 app stores that would get us access to over 70% of users. But China changes rapidly so it's difficult to keep up. Naturally there's a risk associated with doing business without knowing the local situation. That's why we have local partners, who we rely on primarily to provide user support. We don't actually meet with these local partners; everything is done via email. We work to instill high motivation in our partners by setting up a scheme where success benefits both sides.”</i> (Keiji Takeuchi, Representative Director of Link Kit, creators of the popular Samurai Defender game app.) </p> 
           <p> <span class="subhead section-text-color">Keeping Users Happy</span><br> <i><strong>Chinese users rank loss of interest and lack of fresh content as their main reasons for discontinuing app use.</strong></i><br> <strong>Fact</strong> 49% of users marked a loss of interest while 41% of users stated stale content as their explanation. It’s important to note that app users in China are much more sensitive to lack of fresh content than users in other surveyed markets, such as the US at 19% and Japan at 9%.<br> <strong>Recommendation</strong> Adding fresh content on a regular basis is essential for retaining users.<br> <br> <i><strong>Nearly half of users think that good quality apps have frequent app updates.</strong></i><br> <strong>Fact</strong> 44% of users prefer monthly app updates and 33% prefer weekly updates.<br> <strong>Recommendation</strong> Update your app at least monthly to keep users happy. </p> 
           <p> <span class="subhead section-text-color">Making Great Games</span><br> <i><strong>Gamers in China are much more likely to spend money on buying virtual goods and personalizing characters and avatars.</strong></i><br> <strong>Fact</strong> 32% of Chinese gamers have spent money on personalizing characters, while 43% will pay to stock up on virtual points and coins.<br> <strong>Recommendation</strong> When developing games, providing character personalization and virtual gold as in-app purchase options, could be an incremental monetization strategy.<br> <br> <i><strong>Chinese gamers report they make in-app purchases with much higher frequency than gamers in other markets, but they spend the least on in-game purchases.</strong></i><br> <strong>Fact</strong> 36% of Chinese gamers spend money to advance gameplay or unlock features on a weekly basis, three times greater than other markets surveyed.<br> <strong>Recommendation</strong> In your game, have options of in-game purchases with different price points. </p> 
           <p> <span class="subhead section-text-color">Integrating Ads</span><br> <i><strong>Chinese smartphone users are much more likely than others to engage with in-app ads.</strong></i><br> <strong>Fact</strong> 92% of users in these markets will click on ads. In the US this figure is 35%.<br> <strong>Recommendation</strong> You should strive to create the best possible ad experience inside an app; where an ad is placed and how it affects gameplay and user experience is important.<br> <br> </p>

       <p> Now that you’ve built and launched your app to the world, how do you know whether or not it’s successful? It can be tempting to focus on the total number of downloads as the sole metric of success, but in doing so you may be missing most of the story. Having a lot of users is great, but if your goal is to monetize via in-app purchases, or to promote the adoption of a specific set of new features, focusing on total downloads won’t give you much insight into whether you’re achieving those goals, and what you can do next to improve your app.<br> <br> In this chapter, we’ll discuss how to design and implement an analytics and optimization strategy that can give you deeper insight into how your users are engaging with your app, and how you can use that data to optimize your user experience over the long term. </p>

Based in Austin, Texas, with more than 80 full-time employees, they have shipped more than a dozen products with combined sales of more than 75 million units. The most notable among those are co-development on the Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty, and Halo franchises. Most recently, Certain Affinity has been working on their first mobile Title, Age of Booty: Tactics. Age of Booty: Tactics is an asynchronous turn based tactics game hybridized with a collectable card game. Certain Affinity wanted a solution enabling them to measure and analyze specific metrics to influence both the pre-release and post-release designs of the game. They researched a number of analytics solutions, but were frequently frustrated by the cost, size, and limited flexibility offered. </p>

         <p> <strong>Ramping Up Reporting</strong><br> Certain Affinity has used Google Analytics for website analytics since 2005, and began talking to mobile partners after becoming aware of Google Analytics’ (GA‘s) application in mobile gaming. Given their existing experience, the relative cost of the platform, and the extensive feature set, Certain Affinity quickly and easily integrated GA into the game. The early inclusion of GA into the design process resulted in easy access to analytics to assist in influencing direction across design, art, and ultimately production.<br> <br> <strong>UI Optimization</strong><br> Google Analytics provides an intuitive way to understand engagement across multiple screens and events. By leveraging engagement flow and average screen time analytics, Certain Affinity understood when specific areas within the UI were either too complex or buried to drive the desired behavior. They identified that the storefront was overly complex and required significant streamlining to become easily accessible. Additionally, they found that a number of options withinthe menus were too complex and lead to users looping within the UI prior to engaging in an actual game. </p> 
        </div> 
        <div class="module text-column-container" data-module="textcolumns"> 
         <p> <strong>Gameplay Duration</strong><br> Certain Affinity wanted to better understand the average duration of play to optimize the experience on mobile. Given that users tend to spend less time gaming on their mobile devices than in the console space, it was vital to ensure the game was consumable and enjoyable in the “bite sized” engagement window. Certain Affinity leveraged session durations to understand the existing top-level behavior. In analyzing the data, they found that the typical session was over 25% longer in length than was ideal. They tracked events such as turn submission, undo, and return to main menu to identify any behavior that was artificially extending the average duration of play. Certain Affinity then specifically targeted optimization to the areas requiring the most work.<br> <br> <strong>Custom Dimensions</strong><br> By leveraging Google Analytics Custom Dimensions, Certain Affinity could measure analytics across a number of key metrics in the mobile gaming space including retention, virality, and monetization. While this data was not widely used until launch, the ability to verify collection was instrumental in ensuring a successful soft launch. <i>“The flexibility GA provides is quite amazing. While no analytics provider will ever have everything you need out of the box, it is great to have a solution that allows us to implement our own requirements [through custom variables], so easily!”</i> explains Certain Affinity’s Lead Server Engineer.<br> <br> <strong>The Power of Data</strong><br> Since Certain Affinity began leveraging Google Analytics, there was a shift in how they develop and implement within their studio. Development is no longer a strictly qualitative process, but is supported and elevated through the use of analytics and data on a daily basis. Reporting is streamlined due to the increased simplicity, fidelity, and accessibility that Google Analytics provides. </p>

       <p> <span class="subheader">Setting up for Success</span>Before collecting any data or running any reports, it’s critical to spend some time determining what business or user experience questions you’d like to be able to answer. For example:<br> <br> </p> 
       <ul class="bullets"> 
        <li>Are you increasing the rate which users complete an in-app purchase or non-monetary goal (like a signup or level completion)? </li> 
        <li>If the length of each engagement with your app is important, are you improving the average length of a session with your app?

        <li>If you’re running marketing campaigns to acquire more users, which are performing at or under your target cost-per-acquisition (CPA), and which aren’t? <a class="module section-text-color" data-module="lightbox" href="/admob/images/businesskit/lightbox/figure2.png">View Figure 2</a> </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> List out all the data points you’ll need to answers those questions. For example, which screens do you need to measure impressions for? Which user interactions, like button presses, form submits, in-app purchase completions etc. would you need to measure?<br> <br> If you’re running paid marketing campaigns, consider which channels you’ll need to measure, and which downstream user activities, like goal completions or in-app purchases, you’ll want to measure to gauge the return on your marketing investment. </p>

       <p> <span class="subheader">Getting the Data you Need</span>Now that you’re ready to implement a solution for your app, how do you know which third-party solution to use, or whether to develop tools in-house? When considering an analytics solution, whether it be third-party or your own, consider these questions to help you decide what’s going to be the best fit for your app and your business:<br> <br> </p> 
       <ul class="bullets"> 
        <li>Will this solution get you the data you need to answer your top acquisition, engagement, and monetization questions? </li> 
        <li>What is the cost of implementation and maintenance for this solution? </li> 
        <li>Do the benefits of getting answers to your most pressing user experience and business questions outweigh these costs? </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> As you think about the costs of deploying and maintaining your analytics solution, consider using Google Tag Manager, which enables you to configure your analytics implementation from the cloud and can dramatically reduce maintenance and deployment costs. <a class="module section-text-color" data-module="lightbox" href="/admob/images/businesskit/lightbox/figure3.png">View Figure 3</a> </p>

      <span class="subheader">Taking Action</span> 
      <div class="text-column-container"> 
       <p> Collecting data and building reports adds no value to your business on its own. The value comes from being able to use that data to answer your most important business and user experience questions, and then being able to take action on those insights to improve your app and grow your business.<br> <br> In order for this to happen, the data you collect needs to get into the hands of those who can do great analysis, and who can actually affect change on the product. Sometimes these are the same person (and maybe it’s you), but in larger companies and development studios, it’s important to identify who can do the analysis you need, and who can actually implement changes based on that analysis, like a product or engineering team.<br> <br> Google Analytics can make providing access to data to the teams to the right people within your company easy. Google Analytics offers flexible, enterprise-ready user permissions, the ability to generate and share custom reports and dashboards, and a Core Reporting API that allows you to export your data into your own visualizations and other internal systems.<br> <br> Ultimately the real value of gathering data and performing analysis comes from the actions you are able to take as a result of your insights. Are users not using the new feature you just launched? Try making the button or link more prominent, and compare week-over-week or month-over-month adoption. If a particular marketing campaign is driving downloads under your target cost-per-acquisition (CPA), consider increasing investment in that campaign and measuring whether you can acquire more users within your target CPA.<br> <br> To make changes to your application more quickly based on your analysis, consider using Google Tag Manager for Mobile, which enables you to push updated configurations to your app on the fly, without needing to resubmit your app to marketplaces, or waiting for users to choose to update to the latest version. <a class="module section-text-color" data-module="lightbox" href="/admob/images/businesskit/lightbox/figure4.png">View Figure 4</a> </p>
