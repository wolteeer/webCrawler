           <p>Educators who have led successful change with technology often repeat the mantra: "start with the learning". Once you've established clear goals, your school or university can select the technology solutions that will improve your likelihood of success. For example, is your emphasis on improving exam results? Or is the goal to increase student engagement, both inside and outside of the institution? Visit other institutions that are role models for you. Spend time with them to understand their goals and how they got there.</p>

For more information, refer to the <a data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Technical Transition Guide" href="/pdfs/guide/gapps-transition-guide.pdf" target="_blank">technical transition guide</a> </li> 
             <li><strong> Set up a portal for distributing accounts/password </strong><br> The distribution of accounts/passwords should be automated and seamless. Many schools create a portal where users can quickly and easily sign up for an Apps account and receive a temporary password. </li> 
             <li><strong> Develop an automated password reset policy </strong><br> Users – especially overworked, stressed-out students – can (and do) forget their passwords. The simplest solution is to have all users provide a password recovery email and phone number during the initial activation of their account, so that password reset requests need not be directed to a helpdesk. You can further reduce your helpdesk’s workload by routing the password retrieval process through the portal set up to distribute accounts and passwords (described above). </li>

           <p>More and more schools are enabling web-based learning through G Suite. Here are a few case studies highlighting the challenges several schools have faced recently, as well as some of the benefits they have enjoyed:</p> 
           <div class="guide-more-details"> 
            <ul> 
             <li> In Bangkok, Thailand, Mattayomwatnairong Schools adopted G Suite for Education to enable web-based learning for their K-12 students. As a result, students were able to continue their education with fewer disruptions, even when schools were closed during such crisis situations as floods or protests. <a class="lb" data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Watch Video" data-lightbox-height="340" data-lightbox-width="550" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZNUMkdkw&amp;autoplay=1" target="_blank" data-lightbox-index="0">Watch video</a> </li> 
             <li> The Municipality of Vicente López (MVL) is a school district in Buenos Aires, Argentina that provides educational instruction to more than 3,600 students. Prior to adopting a web-based solution, access to content was restricted to on-site computer labs. But now with G Suite, students and teachers can access content anywhere, on any device, enabling them to become active content consumers (and producers). The improved quality of instructional content – combined with more channels for collaboration – engages students, facilitates self-directed study, and makes students more receptive to feedback from their teachers and classmates. <a class="lb" data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Watch Video" data-lightbox-height="340" data-lightbox-width="550" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2seSSimGr6U&amp;autoplay=1" target="_blank" data-lightbox-index="1">Watch video</a> </li> 
             <li> At India’s Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) in Pilani, administrators observed several immediate benefits following the university-wide deployment of G Suite. Their old server had limited storage capacity, which frequently caused emails to bounce back and made communication difficult. But post-deployment of Apps, the university’s enhanced storage capabilities enabled increased academic collaboration while delivering savings in both capital and operational expenditures. University users – especially off-campus students – have benefited from using Apps to facilitate collaboration, particularly the tools that allow them to share video files, record lectures, and present slides. <a data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Read Case Study" href="/pdfs/guide/bits-pilani.pdf" target="_blank">Read case study (PDF)</a> </li> 
             <li> Petra Christian University in Indonesia reduced time and money spent on valuable IT resources with a stable communication platform: G Suite. Their legacy server-based systems had been costly, insecure, and unstable. With every power outage, the on-premise mail servers crashed and required excessive maintenance. Now these resources are deployed by developing internal apps that will continue to improve education at Petra. <a data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Read Case Study" href="/pdfs/guide/petra-christian-university.pdf" target="_blank">Read case study (PDF)</a> </li>

           <h2>Integrate your solution</h2> 
           <p> It’s not enough to simply deploy web-based tools. You must make sure they are relevant by integrating them with your school’s day-to-day activities, as well as your third-party software and existing legacy systems. Use Section B of the <a data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="School Engagement Due Dilligence" href="/pdfs/guide/school-engagement-due-diligence-form.pdf" target="_blank">school engagement due diligence form</a> to help identify core processes to integrate. We recommend connecting G Suite to a Single Sign-On server, so that users can access all internal tools with a single username and password. Many schools also integrate G Suite with learning platforms such as Moodle and Blackbird.

            <ul> 
             <li> Université Cadi Ayyad, Morocco, deployed G Suite accounts as their main authentication platform. Students and staff use their Google accounts to access the Internet over the university WiFi. They also use their accounts to access the university intranet, which was built using Google sites and G Suite scripts. Now students can easily access course material, request transcripts, receive their grades, and log onto the university’s eLearning platform. </li> 
             <li> Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), Kenya, transformed their university services by using Mail, Calendar and Drive to post lecture schedules, course materials, tutorials and research.

           <p>Some considerations during deployment:</p> 
           <div class="guide-more-details"> 
            <ul> 
             <li><strong> Deploy web tools in phases </strong><br> You don’t have to dive into the deep end immediately; it’s easiest (and wisest) to plan your digital deployment in smaller, more manageable steps. For more information, refer to the <a data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Technical Transition Guide" href="/pdfs/guide/gapps-transition-guide.pdf" target="_blank">technical transition guide</a> </li> 
             <li><strong> Set up a portal for distributing accounts/password </strong><br> The distribution of accounts/passwords should be automated and seamless. Many schools create a portal where users can quickly and easily sign up for an Apps account and receive a temporary password. </li> 
             <li><strong> Develop an automated password reset policy </strong><br> Users – especially overworked, stressed-out students – can (and do) forget their passwords. The simplest solution is to have all users provide a password recovery email and phone number during the initial activation of their account, so that password reset requests need not be directed to a helpdesk. You can further reduce your helpdesk’s workload by routing the password retrieval process through the portal set up to distribute accounts and passwords (described above). </li>

           <p>More and more schools are enabling web-based learning through G Suite. Here are a few case studies highlighting the challenges several schools have faced recently, as well as some of the benefits they have enjoyed:</p> 
           <div class="guide-more-details"> 
            <ul> 
             <li> In Bangkok, Thailand, Mattayomwatnairong Schools adopted G Suite for Education to enable web-based learning for their K-12 students. As a result, students were able to continue their education with fewer disruptions, even when schools were closed during such crisis situations as floods or protests. <a class="lb" data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Watch Video" data-lightbox-height="340" data-lightbox-width="550" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZNUMkdkw&amp;autoplay=1" target="_blank" data-lightbox-index="0">Watch video</a> </li> 
             <li> The Municipality of Vicente López (MVL) is a school district in Buenos Aires, Argentina that provides educational instruction to more than 3,600 students. Prior to adopting a web-based solution, access to content was restricted to on-site computer labs. But now with G Suite, students and teachers can access content anywhere, on any device, enabling them to become active content consumers (and producers). The improved quality of instructional content – combined with more channels for collaboration – engages students, facilitates self-directed study, and makes students more receptive to feedback from their teachers and classmates. <a class="lb" data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Watch Video" data-lightbox-height="340" data-lightbox-width="550" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2seSSimGr6U&amp;autoplay=1" target="_blank" data-lightbox-index="1">Watch video</a> </li> 
             <li> At India’s Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) in Pilani, administrators observed several immediate benefits following the university-wide deployment of G Suite. Their old server had limited storage capacity, which frequently caused emails to bounce back and made communication difficult. But post-deployment of Apps, the university’s enhanced storage capabilities enabled increased academic collaboration while delivering savings in both capital and operational expenditures. University users – especially off-campus students – have benefited from using Apps to facilitate collaboration, particularly the tools that allow them to share video files, record lectures, and present slides. <a data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Read Case Study" href="/pdfs/guide/bits-pilani.pdf" target="_blank">Read case study (PDF)</a> </li> 
             <li> Petra Christian University in Indonesia reduced time and money spent on valuable IT resources with a stable communication platform: G Suite. Their legacy server-based systems had been costly, insecure, and unstable. With every power outage, the on-premise mail servers crashed and required excessive maintenance. Now these resources are deployed by developing internal apps that will continue to improve education at Petra. <a data-g-action="Text Link" data-g-event="Edu: Guide: Offer" data-g-label="Read Case Study" href="/pdfs/guide/petra-christian-university.pdf" target="_blank">Read case study (PDF)</a> </li>
